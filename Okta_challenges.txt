1. Writing a java code for Oktafilter which should support spring 4 and wicket framework and doesn't support for spring 5 or boot features during implementation.
2. Understanding spring security logic exist in xml configuration of application and debugging to understand the flow or current security logic exists in our application.
3. Study Ping Agent identity provider working mechanism how to replace it with Okta.
4. Identifying the logic of authentication detail source(metadat like Entitlement, costcenter) from LDAP retriving mechanism.
5. Lots of unused code exist in application which in turn deviates the study of current behaviour of appliaction.
6. Co-ordination with okta team to configure everything from scratch including onborading the groups creating the request for entitlement group.


6. Implemeting spring 4 to spring 5->70+ files and lots of effort on solving compilation error and runtime issues.
7. xml to java configuration approach.


Subject: Update on Challenges Faced and Progress Made During Okta Migration

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide an update on the challenges our team has encountered during the Okta migration process for our application, along with the positive strides we have made to address these issues.

1. **Java Code for OktaFilter**:
   One of our primary tasks involved writing Java code for the OktaFilter that supports both Spring 4 and the Wicket framework. Given that the implementation does not support Spring 5 or Boot features, this required us to develop a custom solution that integrates seamlessly with our existing architecture. Despite the complexity, our team successfully created a robust filter that meets these specific requirements.

2. **Understanding Spring Security Logic**:
   Our application’s security logic, primarily configured through XML, presented a learning curve. We dedicated considerable time to debugging and understanding the current security flow to ensure a smooth transition to Okta. This in-depth analysis enabled us to identify key areas for improvement and ensured that we maintained the integrity of our security protocols during migration.

3. **Studying Ping Agent Identity Provider**:
   To replace our existing identity provider with Okta, we thoroughly studied the Ping Agent’s working mechanism. This research was crucial in understanding how to replicate and enhance our identity management with Okta. We have successfully mapped out a transition plan that maintains the functionality and security of our application.

4. **Identifying LDAP Authentication Logic**:
   Another significant challenge was identifying the logic for retrieving authentication details, such as Entitlement and Costcenter metadata, from LDAP. We have now documented the retrieval mechanism and are in the process of ensuring that this logic is seamlessly integrated with Okta.

5. **Dealing with Unused Code**:
   During our migration efforts, we encountered a substantial amount of unused code within the application. This extraneous code initially deviated our focus from the core behavior of the application. We have since cleaned up the codebase, which has not only streamlined our migration process but also improved overall application performance.

6. **Coordination with Okta Team**:
   Configuring Okta from scratch involved extensive coordination with their team. This included onboarding groups, creating requests for entitlement groups, and setting up various configurations. The collaboration has been fruitful, and we have successfully established the necessary configurations to support our application's security needs.

Despite these challenges, our team’s dedication and collaborative efforts have ensured steady progress. We are confident that the migration to Okta will enhance our security infrastructure and provide a more streamlined identity management experience.

Thank you for your continued support and understanding. Please let us know if you have any questions or need further information.

Best regards,

Subject: Clarification on Entitlements for OCC Application During Okta Migration

Hi Rajeev,

We have observed that the OCC application uses the following sets of entitlements:

- **Set1: Authorities: Groups**
- **Set2: LDAP roles:** fetched using the attribute "b53occentitlements".

These entitlements are being retrieved from ED using LDAP.

Currently, the OCC application (without Okta changes) retrieves entitlements from ED Prod, which includes both Prod and Non-Prod entitlements. However, during the Okta migration for OCC, we found that Okta Stage does not work with ED Prod and instead syncs with ED Stage.

During this process, we discovered that ED Stage does not have any of the entitlements mentioned above. Therefore, we are being asked to submit a request for the creation of these entitlements in ED Stage and to import the users.

We are good with **Set1**, which are groups, and they have been created in ED Stage. However, for **Set2**, we have observed that it has been created as a group in ED Stage (with "g." as a prefix) and does not have the attribute value "b53occentitlement." (There was no field available in the request to specify this attribute.)

Regarding this, we have a few queries:

1. Do we need to follow any special or specific approach for roles creation (not groups)?
2. What about the bundle or role where these entitlements are part of members? For example, [examples of roles].
3. Is there any job that exists to update all references of these entitlements, identifying their membership?
4. Is there any indicator to confirm these entitlement groups are created in ED Stage?
5. Is there a validation or confirmation mechanism to prove that an exact mirror copy of ED Prod (Non-Prod entitlements) has been created in ED Stage?

Questions on ED entitlement fetching mechanism existing in OCC for Prod vs. Non-Prod:

1. If there was no ED Stage existing for Non-Prod entitlements, what was the purpose of having the below ED base URL configuration in OCC?
2. What about the ED URL configuration existing in Non-Prod vs. Prod? Where exactly was "stage" pointing?

Based on these confirmations, we can proceed with the authorization part of the OCC in the Okta migration.

Thank you for your assistance.
