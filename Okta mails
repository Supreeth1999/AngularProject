Dear Team,

As part of our challenge to onboard the OCC application role such as "et.rtl.occ.*" to Okta, we have created the 
corresponding role "g.et.rtl.occ.*" in the ED non-prod environment. A request has been submitted to mirror the users
from the existing ED non-prod role "et.rtl.occ.*" to the newly created "g.et.rtl.occ.*" role in ED non-prod.

Once the user import is complete, we will conduct testing to validate the functionality. 
Following successful testing, we can proceed with the creation of the "g.et.rtl.occ.*" role in the production environment
and request to perform the user mirroring task.

Thank you all for your attention and cooperation!

Best regards,
Supreetha
===================================================
We would like to take a moment to express our sincere thanks for the invaluable guidance and support you provided during the Okta migration for our legacy applications.


We faced numerous challenges throughout this migration. Given that this was the first POC in 5/3, we opted to 
develop a code-based solution instead of using STRATA, which proved to be neither convenient nor cost-effective.
We have faced lots of challenges throughout the Okta Migrtaion for legacy applications,Given that this was the first POC in 5/3, we are bring asked to develop
a code-based solution instead of using STRATA (which is not a convinient solution as i is not cost friendly).


The tasks involved in building the Okta solution were complex(Provided that dealing with an application incompatible with the latest lib-aux versions)
, where everything should build from scratch like 
okta configuration (We had no reference to show how it was configured in FedPing, making it difficult to replicate the setup in Okta), 
and implementing all logic without spring mvc concepts, and integrating Okta’s security model with the existing Wicket/XML implementation.

When we initially reached out to you regarding our understanding of the Ping Agent and the POC for the Okta migration, 
the complexities made it seem like all paths were closed and reaching the finish line felt almost impossible...

You inspired us by telling "Great things always takes time, don't worry, you guys are doing extremely well!! lets not lose the hope we can achieve this!!"
Your true motivational words inspired us, you have provided constant support, expert technical guidance and knowledge,
despite of your busy schedule, you were always available to address our queries and to show the right path!

I truly believe that your guidance and encouragement enlightened our ways and inspired us to accomplish this project! it has been a privilege to work alongside 
someone like you!! your expertise and leadership qualities are tremondous!!

Once again, thank you for everything you’ve done. I look forward to continuing to learn from you and working together on future projects.
