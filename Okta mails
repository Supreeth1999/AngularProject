Dear Team,

As part of our challenge to onboard the OCC application role such as "et.rtl.occ.*" to Okta, we have created the 
corresponding role "g.et.rtl.occ.*" in the ED non-prod environment. A request has been submitted to mirror the users
from the existing ED non-prod role "et.rtl.occ.*" to the newly created "g.et.rtl.occ.*" role in ED non-prod.

Once the user import is complete, we will conduct testing to validate the functionality. 
Following successful testing, we can proceed with the creation of the "g.et.rtl.occ.*" role in the production environment
and request to perform the user mirroring task.

Thank you all for your attention and cooperation!

Best regards,
Supreetha
