Hi Bhaskar,

We are currently facing challenges in tracking logs in the non-production environment using PuTTY. Particularly for applications like Bolt, Countersign, and ApplyHub we are unable to check these logs in Rassa.

We are aware that you are working with Pyarajan on this issue. Could you please involve the team in the ongoing email chain to ensure everyone is aligned and can contribute to a resolution?

Thanks,
Supreetha
