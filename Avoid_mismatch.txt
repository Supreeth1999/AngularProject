Hi Team,

We have implemented a logic in FNA to detect any mismatch between the authenticated employee and the actual user accessing the application.
If a mismatch is identified,the operation will be interrupted, and the user will be redirected to a technical difficulty page.

Logic:
Validate the authentication model data against the principal set during the init method.

Implementation:

If a mismatch is detected:
Create an audit record in TFN_EXCTN_HISTORY with all relevant details.
Throw a custom exception.
Redirect the user to the technical difficulty page.

As part of this change below 3 LD flags are created.


LD flag : Default status: Comment
When this flag is enabled, the entrance filter logic will be executed, which includes:
Clearing the Wicket session
Clearing the servlet session
Resetting the SecurityContextHolder (authentication model)

Flag 2: Enabling this flag will trigger an existing logic (not newly introduced) during the FNA page load, which clears the HTTP session.

Flag 3: Enabling this flag will activate the logic to display the technical difficulty page.

Testing area:

Turning off flag 1 and turning on flag2 and flag 3.

Turning on flag1, flag3 and turing off flag2.

pending test scenario: turning on flag1, flag2 turn off flag3.

Testing scope: Maintaince flow and account origination will be covered.

Need to verify appointment creation and sales activity in FNA to ensure the logic covers these test cases.

challenges: LD interfaces setup needed for offshore to remove onshore dependency.

To set appointments or sales activity need entitlement or resource.
