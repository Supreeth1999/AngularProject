Your springSecurityFilterChain should have the correct filter order.
Here's the expected filter order in Spring Security:

🔢 Order	🔍 Filter	📌 Purpose
1	SecurityContextPersistenceFilter	Restores the SecurityContext for each request.
2	UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter	Handles login authentication (if using form login).
3	BasicAuthenticationFilter	Handles HTTP Basic authentication.
4	BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter	Processes JWT or OAuth2 tokens (if applicable).
5	Your Custom Filters (if any)	(e.g., SecurityContextDebugFilter)
6	FilterSecurityInterceptor	Performs authorization checks.
